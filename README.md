# Statistical Analysis of MD Hysteresis Loop Data

This project involves the statistical analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) data. We reformulate the nucleation process during polarization reversal using the cumulative distribution function (CDF). Additionally, there is a small exercise to find the probability distribution function (PDF) for n 6-sided dice (see `probability.ipynb`).

The provided Jupyter notebook presents data that reproduces the findings published in:
